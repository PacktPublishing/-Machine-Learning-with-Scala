## About the Video Course
The ability to apply machine learning techniques to large datasets is becoming a highly sought-after skill in the world of technology. Scala can help you deliver key insights into your data—its unique capabilities as a language let you build sophisticated algorithms and statistical models. For this reason, machine learning and Scala fit together perfectly and knowledge of both would be beneficial for anyone entering the data science field.

The course starts with a general introduction to the Scala programming language. From there, you’ll be introduced to several practical machine learning algorithms from the areas of exploratory data analysis. You’ll look at supervised learning machine learning models for prediction and classification tasks, and unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction and neural networks.

By the end, you will be comfortable applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems using Scala.
